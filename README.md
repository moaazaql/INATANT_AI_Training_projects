# INATANT_AI_Training_projects
This  Repository contains projects required for artificial intelligence diploma training from INSTANT.
It contains three main projects:
## 1. Emotion_Recognition (Face emotions detection):
This project consists of two parts:
### 1.1 Python code to train a model to Detect facial emotions 
Based on Keras models package
### 1.2 Python code to Detect facial emotions from a given image
Based on DeepFace library 
### 1.3 Live Cam Facial emotion detection.
Based on DeepFace library and open cv.

## 2. Live data dashboard 
Displays the updated change rate for some currencies and a plot chart showing the history of that rate.
Based on Streamlit library.

## 3. Body pose detector and training counter 
It uses the landmarks to reveal the standing position of the body and performs some exercises through the angles between the different landmarks.
Based on Mediapipe library

## And 6 small projects: 
### 1. ridge and lasso: 
A supervised machine learning regression model training to predict next year's customer sales on monthly basis.

### 2.Brain tumor detection:

A Deep learning project that uses sklearn library to train model that predict the presence of brain tumor from brain MIR image.

### 3. Data Analysis Finance: 
A small data analysis project that drows Conclusions from financial dataset to Know the most participant African countries in new investments in Africa.

### 4. Data Analysis Medical Appointment: 

A small data Analysis project that works on more than 100000 medical appointment data in Brazil to detect the elements that affects the decision of the patients to show up or not.

### 5. Deep Learning Digit recognition:

This project uses open cv and keras librarys to train model to recognise hand written dijits.

### 6. ML Disease Prediction: 

A User interface project that takes 5 symptoms from the user and predict the disease based on three machine learning models ,a. Decision tree , b.randomforest, c.NaiveBayes
